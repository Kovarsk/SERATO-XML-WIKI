<!-- This is an example of a simple control mapping for a button on a controller to play a track in Serato DJ software.
When the button is pressed, it plays a track on deck 1, in slot 0, 
and toggles the play state of the track on the controller via an LED.-->

<control channel="14" event_type="Note On" control="20">

<!-- Control is the signal from your controller to the software. 
In this case, the control is a Note On message on MIDI channel 14, with a control number of 20. 
This is the signal that the software receives when you press a button on your controller. -->

        <userio event="click">

        <!-- UserIO event click is the action that the software takes when it receives the control signal.
        
        userio event can be "click" or "output".
        "click" is the action that the software takes when a button gets pressed on the controller
        "output" is the action that the software sends to the controller wich will be set below -->

            <play deck_set="Default" deck_id="1" slot_id="0">

            <!-- The first word "play" is the action that the software takes when it receives the control signal.
            In this case, it plays a track on deck 1. 
            
            deck_set is usually "Default", but it can also be "DJ Effects".
            deck_id is Serato's identification of the deck where the action is applied, usually starts with 0 for deck 1, 1 for deck 2, etc.
            slot_id is what command has to be applied, some actions have multiple possible commands-->

                <!-- Translation sets the behavior of the action.
                In this case, it toggles the play state of the track when the button is pressed. 
                
                action_on can be: 
                                "any" [action is always taken]
                                "release" [action is taken when the button is released];
                                "press" [action is taken when the button is pressed];
                                "hold" [action is taken when the button is held down]. 
                                
                behavior can be: 
                                "toggle" [action is toggled between on and off];                                
                                "momentary" [action is momentary]; 
                                "explicit" [action value is a feedback loop from the status of the controller] -->
